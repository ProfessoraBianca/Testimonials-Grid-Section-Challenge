## My process

Hello again!  üëã

I'm starting to use `grid` better than ever!

I gave it another try at Javascript coding **again** for this project. A mentor helped me to understand better coding and implementations:

> Huge thanks to Bernardo Poggioni for helping me in all those projects ü§ó

**Notes**
- I know I could build custom properties for a lot of things in this project, but I forgot to do it in the beggining and was too tired in the end. I'll implement them next time for better reading and writing of the code. üòâ
  
  
 **Cool Stuff:** I added some hover transitions. Feel free to explore and find out what I did ! üòÅ


**Some questions:**
- I created a `flexbox` for the text on the side of the user images so I could center everything. Is there a better way to do it?

-   How can I improve my codes? ü§î

- Did you liked the cool stuff I added? What would you do differently? 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Grid Layout

- Flexbox

- Javascript
